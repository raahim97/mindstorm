      <li style="font-size: small;"> C++ is an extension of the programming
        language C, a product of AT&T Bell Labs from the early 1970s. C was developed to write the Unix
        operating system, and C is widely used for systems-level software and embedded systems development. 
        C++ is widely used in industry for commercial software development. It is an industrial strength 
        programming language used for developing complex systems in business, science, and engineering. Examples
        of software written in C++ include Microsoft Windows 8, Microsoft Office, Mac OS X, and Adobe Creative
        Suite.</li>

          <li style="font-size: small;"> Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of 
            classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
            which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, 
            C++, Java, and Python. A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent 
            broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, 
            like color, but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.</li>

              <li style="font-size: small;"> Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform 
                operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, 
                for better organization and storage. For example, we have some data which has, player's name "Keane" and age 26. Here "Keane" 
                is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type. We can organize this data as a record like Player record, which will 
                have both player's name and age in it. Now we can collect and store player's records in a file or database as a data structure. 
                For example: "Keane" 30, "Rooney" 31, "Marcelo" 33. If you are aware of Object Oriented programming concepts, then a class also 
                does the same thing, it collects different type of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides 
                for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.</li>

              <li style="font-size: small;"> In theoretical analysis of algorithms, it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic 
                sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. The term "analysis of algorithms" was coined by Donald 
                Knuth.Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the 
                required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Most algorithms are designed to work with inputs of 
                arbitrary length. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.Usually, 
                the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time 
                complexity, or volume of memory, known as space complexity.</li>
